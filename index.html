      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p><strong>Tens of thousands</strong> of low-income households in Tasmania are forced to suffer during the winter in cold, poorly insulated homes, struggling to afford adequate heating. This ongoing issue known as <strong>energy poverty</strong> is especially concentrated in Hobart's northern suburbs and continually contributes to greater financial stress, lower quality of life, and poorer health for struggling Tasmanians.</p>

      <h2>Our Value Proposition and Solution</h2>
      <p>
        The WarmHearth Kit is for low-income Tasmanian households who are needing to stay warm during the winter without making expensive, permanent changes to their homes or increasing their energy bills. Our product is a do-it-yourself home insulation kit that provides affordable tools to reduce heat-loss and increase comfort in older, less energy efficient homes. Unlike the current unaffordable professional grade retrofits and complicated landlord-dependent building changes, the WarmHearth Kit gives Tasmanians usable, renter-safe solutions that they can install themselves to reduce financial stress and make their lives easier.
