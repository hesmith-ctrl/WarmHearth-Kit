      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p><strong>Energy poverty</strong> affects 17% of Tasmanians. Cold climates, old homes, and rising bills leave many in Hobart’s northern suburbs at risk of health issues, stress, and discomfort.</p>

      <h2>Our Value Proposition</h2>
      <p>
        The WarmHearth Kit is for low-income Tasmanian households who are needing to stay warm during the winter without making expensive, permanent changes to their homes or increasing their energy bills. The WarmHearth Kit is a do-it-yourself home insulation kit that provides affordable tools to reduce heat-loss and increase comfort in older, less energy efficient homes. Unlike the current unaffordable professional grade retrofits and complicated landlord-dependent building changes, WarmHearth Kit gives Tasmanians usable, renter-safe solutions that they can install themselves to reduce financial stress and make their lives easier.
